Significant changes to the shades package are laid out below for each release.

===============================================================================

VERSION 1.0.0

- Support for two new colour spaces has been added: LMS, a direct
  representation of the response levels of each of the three colour receptor
  types in the eye; and LCh, a polar representation of Lab space.
- The new dichromat() function can be used to simulate colour blindness.
- The gradient() function now additionally supports predefined colour maps from
  matplotlib and ColorBrewer. Its second argument is now interpreted a little
  differently.
- The hueshift() function has been removed, in favour of the more general
  combination of hue() and delta(). hue(x, delta(y)) is the equivalent of the
  old hueshift(x,y), and delta() can also be used with other colour properties.
- New colour property functions lightness() and chroma() have been added.
- Dimensions are now set when two or more colour properties are changed, and
  the swatch() visualisation function plots multidimensional shades in a grid.
- There is now a rev() method for shades.
- The all.equal() method for shades now passes on its ellipsis argument when
  checking colour coordinates.

===============================================================================

VERSION 0.2.0

- The package has been reworked to use functions from base R to warp colour
  coordinates between spaces and so on. It therefore no longer depends on the
  "colorspace" package, but the list of supported colour spaces has changed
  somewhat as a result.
- The warp() function has been added for colour space conversions.
- New function complement() returns complementary colours, while addmix() and
  submix(), plus infix shorthands, implement additive and subtractive colour
  mixing.
- The new distance() function can be used to calculate a standardised measure
  of the perceptual "distance" between colours.
- The shade class gains indexing and equality operators, plus methods for c(),
  rep() and all.equal().
- There are now accessor functions space() and coords(), for obtaining the
  current space and coordinates of colour vectors.
- The swatch() function now draws grey borders around colour boxes, to make
  the delineation of near-white colours clearer.
