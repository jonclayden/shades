\title{Simulate colour appearance for dichromats}
\usage{
dichromat(shades, type = c("protanopic", "deuteranopic", "tritanopic", "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{shades}{One or more colours, in any suitable form (see
\code{\link{shade}}).}

\item{type}{The type of colour vision deficiency to simulate: protanopia
(red blindness), deuteranopia (green blindness) or tritanopia (blue
blindness). The latter is the rarest in the population. \code{"none"} is
also available, as a pass-through option. Abbrevations, such as the first
letter, may be used, and multiple values are acceptable.}
}
\value{
New colours of class \code{"shade"} in LMS space, representing
  projections of the original shades onto a submanifold appropriate to the
  type of dichromacy being simulated.
}
\description{
This functions manipulates colours to simulate the effects of different
kinds of colour blindness, and specifically dichromacy, in which only two of
the usual three types of photoreceptors are present. There are three types,
corresponding to the loss of red, green or blue photoreceptors.
